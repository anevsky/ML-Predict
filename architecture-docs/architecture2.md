# System Architecture

## Goals & Design Considerations
- **Customer Requirements**: The system should meet the customer's requirement of deploying the ML model behind their firewall.
- **Scalability**: The architecture should be able to scale horizontally to handle increasing loads and model complexities.
- **Performance Monitoring**: The system should provide insights into the performance of the deployed model for monitoring and improvement purposes.
- **Operational Efficiency**: The operational procedures should be streamlined to minimize downtime and ensure quick bug fixes and redeployments.
- **Security**: Security measures should be robust to protect the model and data.
- **Flexibility**: The architecture should be flexible enough to accommodate changes in model versions and updates.

## Architecture
### Assumptions
- The ML model is trained and tested offline and is ready for deployment.
- The customer's infrastructure allows for deployment of containerized applications.
- The customer has a network infrastructure in place for communication with the deployed model.

### Components
1. **Model Deployment Service**: This service is responsible for deploying the ML model onto the customer's infrastructure. It handles the initialization of the model, serving predictions, and performance monitoring.
2. **Monitoring & Logging System**: This component collects metrics related to model performance, system health, and usage statistics. It should be able to handle logs from multiple instances of deployed models.
3. **Bug Tracking & Issue Resolution**: A system for tracking bugs and issues reported by customers. This can be integrated with the monitoring system to detect anomalies and errors.
4. **Version Control & Model Management**: A system for managing different versions of the ML model, allowing for easy rollbacks and updates.
5. **Security Measures**: Includes access controls, encryption, and other security measures to protect the model and data.

### Technology
- **Containerization**: Docker for packaging the ML model and its dependencies into containers, providing portability and consistency across different environments.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing and orchestrating the deployment of containers, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus for collecting metrics, Grafana for visualization, and ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.
- **Bug Tracking**: JIRA, GitHub Issues, or a similar platform for tracking and resolving bugs reported by customers.
- **Version Control**: Git for version control of the ML model code and configuration files.
- **Security**: TLS/SSL for encryption, OAuth or LDAP for authentication, and firewall rules for access control.

## Operations
- **Bug Reporting & Resolution**: When a bug is reported by the customer, it should be logged in the bug tracking system. The operations team should investigate the issue, identify the root cause, and develop a fix. Once the fix is tested and verified, it should be deployed using the version control and model management system.
- **Performance Monitoring**: The monitoring system should continuously collect metrics related to model performance and system health. Any anomalies or performance degradation should trigger alerts for immediate attention.
- **Redeployment & Updates**: When a new version of the ML model is ready for deployment or when updates are required, the operations team should use the version control and model management system to deploy the new version. This process should be automated as much as possible to minimize downtime and ensure consistency across deployments.
- **Security Updates**: Regular security updates should be applied to the deployed infrastructure and containers to protect against potential vulnerabilities. Patch management should be part of the operational procedures to ensure the system remains secure.
