- **Components:** It typically includes a web server or an API endpoint that exposes the model's inference capabilities.
- **Rationale:** By separating the model serving layer from other components, we can ensure scalability and fault isolation. It allows the model to be accessed by multiple clients without exposing the underlying infrastructure.

### Model Execution Environment:

- **Description:** This component hosts the ML model and its dependencies.
- **Components:** It may consist of containers (e.g., Docker) or virtual machines (e.g., AWS EC2 instances) configured to run the model.
- **Rationale:** By encapsulating the model within a container or virtual machine, we ensure consistent behavior across different environments. It also simplifies deployment and dependency management.

### Networking Infrastructure:

- **Description:** This component provides network connectivity between the model serving layer, the execution environment, and external systems.
- **Components:** It may include VPNs, firewalls, routers, and load balancers.
- **Rationale:** Ensuring secure communication between components behind the customer's firewall is critical. VPNs can establish a secure tunnel, while firewalls and routers can enforce access controls and traffic filtering.

### Security Measures:

- **Description:** This component encompasses security measures to protect the deployed model and customer data.
- **Components:** Encryption protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL), authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, LDAP), and access controls.
- **Rationale:** Security is paramount when deploying sensitive ML models. Encryption ensures data confidentiality during transit, while authentication and access controls prevent unauthorized access to the system.

### Monitoring and Logging:

- **Description:** This component collects metrics and logs for monitoring the health and performance of the deployed model.
- **Components:** Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and logging infrastructure (e.g., ELK stack).
- **Rationale:** Monitoring and logging provide visibility into system behavior, aiding in performance optimization, issue diagnosis, and compliance with SLAs. It enables proactive detection and resolution of issues.

## Trade-offs and Considerations

- **Complexity vs. Flexibility:** The chosen architecture may introduce complexity, especially in managing networking infrastructure and security measures. However, this complexity is necessary to ensure flexibility and customization to meet the customer's specific requirements.
- **Performance vs. Security:** Implementing stringent security measures (e.g., encryption, authentication) may introduce overhead and impact performance. Striking the right balance between security and performance is crucial.
- **Cost vs. Scalability:** Certain components (e.g., VPNs, load balancers) may incur additional costs. Balancing cost considerations with scalability requirements is essential to ensure cost-effectiveness without compromising system performance.
- **Operational Overhead:** Managing and maintaining the deployed system, especially in a customer's infrastructure, may require additional operational overhead. Automating deployment, monitoring, and maintenance processes can mitigate this overhead.
- **Customer Requirements:** Aligning the system architecture with the customer's requirements is paramount. Iterative discussions and collaboration with the customer are necessary to ensure that the architecture meets their specific needs and constraints.

# 3) Key technologies that support each component of the architecture
