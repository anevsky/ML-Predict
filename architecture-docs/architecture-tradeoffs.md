# System Architecture

## Key Design Considerations and Open Questions
1. **Scalability vs. Performance**: How to balance the need for scalability with optimal model performance under varying loads?
2. **Security Measures**: What specific security measures should be implemented to ensure data protection within the customer's infrastructure?
3. **Monitoring Strategy**: Which metrics are critical for monitoring model performance, and how should they be tracked and analyzed?
4. **Containerization Strategy**: What are the implications of containerizing the application with Docker in terms of deployment and resource utilization?

## General System Architecture
- **FastAPI Application**: Handling HTTP requests and serving as the interface for model inference.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The core component responsible for predictions based on input data.
- **Docker Containers**: Utilized for containerization to ensure portability and ease of deployment behind the customer's firewall.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Integration with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring system performance and logging operational events.
- **Security Layer**: Implementation of encryption, authentication, and access controls to safeguard data.

### Justification and Tradeoffs
- Microservices architecture allows for modularity and scalability. However, it introduces complexity in managing inter-service communication and deployment.
- Docker containers offer consistency across environments but might introduce overhead in terms of resource consumption.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: For developing the FastAPI application and ML model.
- **FastAPI**: Provides a high-performance framework for building APIs.
- **Docker**: For containerization and managing dependencies.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: For monitoring and visualization of system metrics.
- **Security Protocols**: HTTPS, JWT, TLS for ensuring secure communication and data encryption.
- **Logging Framework**: Python's built-in logging module or similar libraries for capturing events.

## Operational Story
### Bug Reporting and Resolution Process
1. **Understanding the Bug**: Customer reports a bug in the system.
2. **Bug Triage**: The support team assesses the severity and impact of the reported bug.
3. **Issue Logging**: The bug is logged in the issue tracking system with relevant details.
4. **Diagnosis and Fixing**: Development team investigates the bug, identifies the root cause, and develops a fix.
5. **Testing**: The fix is tested in a controlled environment to ensure it resolves the reported issue without introducing regressions.
6. **Deployment**: The fixed version is deployed using CI/CD pipelines or manual deployment processes.
7. **Verification**: Post-deployment verification is conducted to ensure the bug is resolved and no new issues are introduced.
8. **Customer Communication**: The customer is informed about the resolution and provided with any necessary instructions or updates.
