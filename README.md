# Machine Learning app for recommendation / classification using Python / FastAPI / Docker (client-server)

![alt architecture-diagram](architecture-diagram.png "Architecture Diagram")

## Overview
This ML predict project centers around deploying and providing API for machine learning models. 

There are three parts:
1) We start with a ML model that needs to be built into a service. 
2) Then we are going to pack and deploy this service. 
3) Finally, we are goint to to design an architecture for deploying this model into a customer's infrastructure.

We will use a ML model that we consider to be a geometry encoder whose outputs inform a recommendation system for generative engineering design.

The recommendations would be served to the user via a web app.

## Part 1: Model serving
We will take a pretrained model and prepare it for serving. We are going to use web server framework like FastAPI.

The following files relevant for this part:
- A requirements.txt
- A client.py which, when run, will ping the model server with an example input and print the result of a correctness test (pass or fail)
- A skeleton server.py which contains functions to load the model and make a prediction
- A model.pkl which contains the pretrained model

Running server.py to bring up the server should produce no errors, and then running client.py should output a success message. 

## Part 2: Package and build
We want to deploy this model to multiple environments by packaging it as a Docker container.

The provided repo contains these files for this part of the project:
- Dockerfile
- build.sh
- deploy.sh

The following things should work:
- Running build.sh should execute the container build step
- Running deploy.sh should bring up the container as a server like in the last section
- As before, running client.py should ping the container from outside and produce a success message

## Part 3: System architecture and deployment
Now, imagine you want to deploy this model to a customer. The customer requires this to be on their infrastructure behind a firewall. Weâ€™d like to get information about the model's performance back to our systems for monitoring operations and improving the model.

A few things to focus on:
- What are the most important design considerations and open questions to guide decision making?
- What general system architecture would you employ here? Defend your choices and discuss tradeoffs.
- What technology supports the proposed architecture?
- What is the operational story? Consider a bug reported by the customer: what is the process for understanding, fixing, and redeploying?

We are not going to be super detailed on everything because you can imagine that you're in week 1 of this project, we just want to demostrate how to approach this type of problem from a clean sheet.

## Architecture Goals & Design Considerations
The primary goals of the architecture are:
- Deploying an ML model using Python and FastAPI.
- Hosting the system behind a customer's firewall for security and compliance reasons.
- Monitoring model performance and operations for continuous improvement.

Design considerations include:
- Scalability to handle varying levels of incoming requests.
- Modularity to allow easy integration of additional components or updates.
- Cost implications of deploying and maintaining the infrastructure. Optimize resource usage and consider cost-effective alternatives where possible.
- Security measures to ensure data protection within the customer's infrastructure.

## Trade-offs and Considerations

- **Scalability vs. Performance**: How to balance the need for scalability with optimal model performance under varying loads?
- **Complexity vs. Flexibility:** The chosen architecture may introduce complexity, especially in managing networking infrastructure and security measures. However, this complexity is necessary to ensure flexibility and customization to meet the customer's specific requirements.
- **Performance vs. Security:** Implementing stringent security measures (e.g., encryption, authentication) may introduce overhead and impact performance. Striking the right balance between security and performance is crucial.
- **Cost vs. Scalability:** Certain components (e.g., VPNs, load balancers) may incur additional costs. Balancing cost considerations with scalability requirements is essential to ensure cost-effectiveness without compromising system performance.
- **Operational Overhead:** Managing and maintaining the deployed system, especially in a customer's infrastructure, may require additional operational overhead. Automating deployment, monitoring, and maintenance processes can mitigate this overhead.
- **Customer Requirements:** Aligning the system architecture with the customer's requirements is paramount. Iterative discussions and collaboration with the customer are necessary to ensure that the architecture meets their specific needs and constraints.
- **Security Measures**: What specific security measures should be implemented to ensure data protection within the customer's infrastructure?
- **Monitoring Strategy**: Which metrics are critical for monitoring model performance, and how should they be tracked and analyzed?
- **Containerization Strategy**: What are the implications of containerizing the application with Docker in terms of deployment and resource utilization?

## Architecture
### Assumptions
- The customer's infrastructure supports Docker containers for deployment.
- Monitoring and logging tools are available for performance tracking.
- The customer has a network infrastructure that allows inbound traffic to reach the deployed system, collect and send statistics back to our system.

### Model Serving Layer:

- **Description:** This layer is responsible for serving predictions generated by the ML model.
- **Components:** It typically includes a web server or an API endpoint that exposes the model's inference capabilities.
- **Rationale:** By separating the model serving layer from other components, we can ensure scalability and fault isolation. It allows the model to be accessed by multiple clients without exposing the underlying infrastructure.

### Model Execution Environment:

- **Description:** This component hosts the ML model and its dependencies.
- **Components:** It may consist of containers (e.g., Docker) or virtual machines (e.g., AWS EC2 instances) configured to run the model.
- **Rationale:** By encapsulating the model within a container or virtual machine, we ensure consistent behavior across different environments. It also simplifies deployment and dependency management.

### Networking Infrastructure:

- **Description:** This component provides network connectivity between the model serving layer, the execution environment, and external systems.
- **Components:** It may include VPNs, firewalls, routers, and load balancers.
- **Rationale:** Ensuring secure communication between components behind the customer's firewall is critical. VPNs can establish a secure tunnel, while firewalls and routers can enforce access controls and traffic filtering.

### Components
1. **FastAPI Application**: Responsible for exposing endpoints to interact with the ML model. Handles incoming HTTP requests and orchestrates model inference.

2. **Machine Learning Model**: The core component responsible for making predictions based on input data.

3. **Docker Containerization**: The system will be containerized using Docker to ensure consistency across environments and easy deployment.

4. **Monitoring & Logging**: Integration with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to collect metrics and track system performance. Logging mechanisms for capturing errors, warnings, and operational events.

5. **Security Layer**: Implementation of security measures such as encryption, authentication, and access controls to safeguard data and restrict unauthorized access.

### Technology
- **Python**: For developing the FastAPI application and ML model.
- **FastAPI**: As the web framework for building RESTful APIs with Python.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and its dependencies.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: For monitoring and visualizing system metrics.
- **Security Protocols**: HTTPS for secure communication, JWT for authentication, TLS for data encryption.
- **Logging Framework**: Python's built-in logging module or alternative logging libraries.

## Operations
1. **Deployment**: The Dockerized application will be deployed within the customer's infrastructure behind their firewall. Deployment scripts or tools (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes) will facilitate the process.

2. **Monitoring & Logging Setup**: Configure Prometheus for collecting metrics and Grafana for visualization. Implement logging mechanisms within the application to capture relevant events.

3. **Performance Tracking**: Continuously monitor system performance, including response times, error rates, and resource utilization. Use collected data to identify bottlenecks and optimize the system accordingly.

4. **Security Measures**: Regularly review and update security measures to ensure compliance with industry standards and address any potential vulnerabilities. Conduct periodic security audits and assessments.

5. **Maintenance & Updates**: Schedule maintenance windows for applying patches, updates, and enhancements to the system. Implement versioning strategies to manage changes effectively.

6. **Incident Response**: Establish procedures for handling security incidents, system failures, or performance issues. Define escalation paths and response protocols to minimize downtime and mitigate risks.
